This is a simple build of Tic Tac Toe that uses a 3 by 3 table to create the game board.

From a logic standpoint each cell on the game board has a matching position in the gameBoard array that tracks the game.

A series of conditional if statements made after a player makes their selection checks the array to see if a win condition exists, or if the game has become a tie.
